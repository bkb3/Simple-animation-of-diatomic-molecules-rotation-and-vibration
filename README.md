# Simple-animation-of-diatomic-molecules-rotation-and-vibration
Here I have tried a very simple simulation the motion of a homonuclear diatomic molecule. This includes rotational motion, vibrational motion and translational motion.

# HOW TO!

  - press shift + enter at the end of code and run the slider.

# TO DO
  - make vibrations more visible
  - add translation with a suitable background to give a sense of relative motion.
